# Intro <a name = "Intro"></a>

This project was previously developed for 'RodrigoMS', found on YouTube with the title """ HTML e CSS - Formulário Responsivo Flexbox""".

However, during my development the main change is that I created the project in react-vite. And for this, instead of the index.html and style.css files I used the app.js and app.css files; and placed the form and background parallelogram each in a separate component.



# Feature <a name = "Feature"></a>
- Simple Signup form
- Responsive layout

# Technologies <a name = "Technologies"></a>

In youtube's video this project was developed with Html, CSS.

However, during my development the main change is that I created the project in VITE, creating the form, general form, image components; where the form and image components were called in the general form; and the general form was called in app.jsx; and beyond that, I also changed the background color of the button on hover to make the change more visible.
